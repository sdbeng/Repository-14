Welcome to my Angular JS Project.

I was able to take things off the ground fast by working with the yeoman-grunt-bower trio.

You will never come back to the old way of developing and building manually all the code structure that waste sometimes precious time.

Now, exploring with the addition of multiple controllers and how they interact each other in an orgaanized manner so I can come back 2 weeks from now and find myself picking up the code just fine.

Thanks for visiting.
